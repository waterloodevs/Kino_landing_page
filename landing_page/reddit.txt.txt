Hey everyone!

We wanted to introduce a project we have been working on for the past couple of months. Kino 
is a mobile rewards platform that allows you to earn Kin for shopping at places like
McDonalds, Nike, Uber, Netflix, Amazon, Sephora and more. You are also able to redeem your Kin for
exclusive (discount?) offers catered to your spending habits.

How it works:
1. Link your cards
2. Shop at your favorite places
3. Earn Kin
3. Redeem for special offers

We have been working hard to hold ourselves to the same deadlines set forth by Kin developer 
program. We will be launching our beta soon. If you are interested, please sign up here:

P.s. Feel free to drop us a line, we are based out of Waterloo and are always looking to connect with like minded people.
